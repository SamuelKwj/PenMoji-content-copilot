# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-06-18

### Phase 1: Product Direction & Scope
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Locked product shape as local desktop agent workbench plus mini-program inspiration capture.
  - Clarified that the mini-program is for quick mobile inspiration capture and sync, not a full AI workbench.
  - Clarified that v1 cloud scope is light: account, subscription/license, inspiration queue, version metadata.
  - Clarified that v1 LLM usage is BYOK by default.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`

### Phase 2: Local Desktop Workbench Scaffold
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Created a standard-library Python local HTTP service.
  - Added endpoints for status, config, chat, inbox, sync, files, and license status.
  - Added browser UI for the v1 desktop workbench.
  - Added masked API key handling so `********` does not overwrite the saved secret.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/main.py`
  - `content-workbench/run.bat`
  - `content-workbench/README.md`
  - `content-workbench/static/index.html`

### Phase 3: Mobile & Cloud Sync Contract
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Defined the mini-program inspiration item schema.
  - Defined cloud API expectations for mobile submission, subscription status, and device linking.
  - Defined desktop sync behavior and added a local simulation endpoint.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/docs/mobile-cloud-contract.md`

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Ran Python syntax check on `content-workbench/main.py`.
  - Started the local server on `http://127.0.0.1:7870`.
  - Smoke-tested `/api/status`, `/api/config`, `/api/chat`, `/api/sync/inspirations`, `/api/inbox`, and `/api/files`.
  - Confirmed homepage HTML returns `200` and includes the expected title.
  - Tightened static file serving and empty project path handling.
  - Restarted the local server after code changes and repeated smoke checks.
  - Moved the default content project under `%USERPROFILE%\.content-workbench\projects\default-content-project`.
  - Removed test inbox data that had been written into the source `Content Creator Pipeline` bundle before the default path was corrected.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/main.py`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`

### Phase 5: MVP Implementation
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Replaced the chat-only scaffold with a guided workflow router for `灵感固化`, `审核`, `评分`, `预测`, `视频脚本`, `标题/发布文字`, and `静态页文案`.
  - Added optional OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` calls using saved `api_base_url`, `api_key`, and `model`.
  - Added deterministic local fallback output so the MVP remains usable without a configured API key.
  - Added artifact persistence under `%USERPROFILE%\.content-workbench\projects\default-content-project\deliverables`.
  - Added `POST /api/inbox/produce` so a synced mobile inspiration starts the guided workflow at spark solidification.
  - Added `cloud_mock.py` with mobile inspiration submission, desktop pending pull, ack, device binding, and subscription status.
  - Added UI buttons for inbox-to-production, cloud pulling, and device binding.
  - Added `run-mvp.bat` for launching the desktop service and local cloud mock together.
  - Added `mobile-miniapp/`, a minimal WeChat Mini Program project for mobile inspiration capture and status viewing.

### Phase 6: Beginner Workflow Simplification
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Reframed the product as a beginner workflow assistant, not a Hermes-style command workbench.
  - Removed video-production framing from the core route.
  - Changed the workflow to `灵感固化 -> 审核 -> 评分 -> 预测 -> 视频脚本 -> 静态页/文字物料`.
  - Changed generic user input to produce only a spark card and next-step guidance.
  - Changed Inbox UI to a single `开始流程` action instead of multiple production buttons.
  - Added next-step prompts in chat replies.
  - Reordered the narrow/in-app browser layout so the guided workflow appears before settings.
  - Hid processed inbox items by default so old test records do not imply the product still generates full packages.
  - Cleaned workflow command prefixes from generated artifact folder names.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/main.py`
  - `content-workbench/static/index.html`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`

### Phase 7: Message/UI Cleanup
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Inspected the in-app browser at `http://127.0.0.1:7870/`.
  - Confirmed old processed test inbox entries contained misleading phrases such as "电脑生成全套".
  - Updated the UI to show only pending/unprocessed inspirations in the default inspiration list.
  - Added Chinese labels for inspiration type and status.
  - Moved the primary guided workflow to the left/first visible area, with settings on the right.
  - Updated topic extraction so requests like `全套物料：xxx` still save artifacts under the real topic name only.
  - Renamed remaining visible product shell text to `灵感到脚本`, `引导流程`, `灵感`, `手机同步`, and `产物`.
  - Removed the visible default Debug tab and old `Agent Chat` wording from the beginner UI.
  - Added clickable `继续：下一步` actions after workflow replies.
  - Fixed route priority so prompts like `审核这个灵感` produce review only instead of review plus spark card.
  - Restarted the local `7870` service.
- Verification:
  - Python syntax check passed for `content-workbench\main.py` and `content-workbench\cloud_mock.py`.
  - Browser screenshot confirmed the first viewport now starts with `脚本工作流助手` and `引导流程`.
  - `POST /api/chat` with `全套物料：普通人为什么做个人IP总是半途而废` returned `stage=guided_workflow`, `deliverables=spark_card`, `next=审核`.
  - The generated artifact path did not contain `全套物料`.
  - Route matrix confirmed generic/full/review/score/prediction/script/static-page requests advance one workflow step at a time.
  - Served HTML no longer contains visible `Agent Chat`, `Debug`, `全套物料`, `生成视频`, `导出视频`, or `成片`.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/main.py`
  - `content-workbench/static/index.html`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`

### Phase 8: Notion/Taskade-Style Workflow Board UI
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Replaced the previous two-column UI with a three-column workflow board inspired by the selected Notion/Taskade direction.
  - Added a left `灵感库` with quick idea capture, pending inspiration cards, and phone sync controls.
  - Added a center `6 步内容流程` with explicit step cards for `灵感固化`, `审核`, `评分`, `预测`, `视频脚本`, and `文字物料`.
  - Added a right inspector with `下一步`, local artifact list, and secondary settings sections.
  - Added active-topic state so users load one idea and then move through workflow steps.
  - Added an inline favicon to avoid browser `/favicon.ico` 404 console noise.
  - Fixed backend route priority so explicit step prompts such as `固化这个灵感：验证选题...` are not misrouted by keywords inside the topic text.
  - Restarted the local `7870` service after the backend route fix.
- Verification:
  - `GET /api/status` on `http://127.0.0.1:7870` returned `status=ok`.
  - Served HTML contains `灵感库`, `6 步内容流程`, `下一步`, `模型与保存位置`, and the three-column layout rule.
  - Served HTML does not contain visible old `Agent Chat` or `data-tab="debug"` UI.
  - Playwright desktop check saw title `灵感到脚本`, 6 workflow cards, active-topic loading, no visible `Agent Chat`, no visible debug tab, and no console errors after adding the favicon.
  - Playwright mobile check saw `灵感到脚本`, `灵感库`, `6 步内容流程`, `下一步`, 6 workflow cards, and no console errors.
  - Direct Python route check proved:
    - `固化这个灵感：验证选题...` -> `spark_solidify`, `spark_card`
    - `审核这个灵感：验证选题...` -> `review`
    - `给这个选题评分：验证选题...` -> `score`
    - `全套物料：验证选题...` -> `guided_workflow`, `spark_card`
  - Runtime HTTP route check against `http://127.0.0.1:7870/api/chat` proved the running service now routes:
    - `固化这个灵感：验证选题...` -> `spark_solidify`, `spark_card`, next `审核`
    - `审核这个灵感：验证选题...` -> `review`, next `评分`
    - `给这个选题评分：验证选题...` -> `score`, next `预测`
    - `全套物料：验证选题...` -> `guided_workflow`, `spark_card`, next `审核`
  - Final Playwright desktop check clicked the first workflow step with a topic containing `验证` and received `灵感固化卡`, next step `审核`, 6 step cards, no old `Agent Chat`, no visible debug tab, and no console errors.
  - Final Playwright mobile check saw `灵感到脚本`, `灵感库`, `6 步内容流程`, `下一步`, 6 step cards, and no console errors.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/main.py`
  - `content-workbench/static/index.html`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`

### Phase 8 Follow-up: Restore Original Function-Block Layout
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - User clarified that the requested UI work was about color, visual style, and interaction effects, not changing the functional block structure.
  - Reverted `content-workbench/static/index.html` from the three-column workflow-board UI back to the previous function-block layout.
  - Restored visible blocks: `引导流程`, `素材与产物`, `灵感`, `手机同步`, `产物`, and right-side `基础设置` / `授权`.
  - Kept the backend explicit route-priority fix in `main.py` because it corrects a workflow bug and does not alter the visible UI block structure.
  - Updated planning and handoff documents so future UI work preserves the function blocks and focuses on palette, spacing, hover/active states, visual hierarchy, and subtle interaction feedback.
- Verification:
  - `GET /` contains `引导流程`, `素材与产物`, and `基础设置`.
  - `GET /` no longer contains `6 步内容流程`, `灵感库`, or `nextCard`.
  - `GET /api/status` returned `status=ok` on `http://127.0.0.1:7870`.
  - `127.0.0.1:7870` is still listening.
  - Final Playwright check confirmed restored layout, hidden debug output, and no browser console errors after adding an inline favicon and enforcing `[hidden]`.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/static/index.html`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`

### Phase 9: Layout Position Adjustment
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Initialized a project-local Git repository in `C:\Users\samue\Documents\内容生产agent`.
  - Created baseline commit `f93f9ab chore: snapshot before layout adjustment`.
  - Changed only layout CSS so `基础设置/授权` moves to the left, while `引导流程` stays in the middle and `素材与产物` stays on the right.
- Verification:
  - Playwright verified actual desktop order by bounding boxes: settings `x=0`, guide `x=294`, materials `x=878.890625`.
  - Playwright verified `基础设置`, `引导流程`, and `素材与产物` are visible with no console errors.
  - `GET /api/status` returned `status=ok` on `http://127.0.0.1:7870`.
- Files created/modified:
  - `.gitignore`
  - `content-workbench/static/index.html`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 10: Clean Entry UI
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Created rollback tag `before-clean-ui-entry-rework` before the larger UI entry redesign.
  - Removed persistent settings/sidebar form from the main canvas and moved model/sync/storage/license settings behind a top-right gear modal.
  - Removed visible `内容形态`, `平台`, and `赛道/人设` form fields from the main UI; the dialogue now tells users to provide those details naturally in chat.
  - Replaced the left rail with a scored `火花看板`.
  - Rebuilt the center as a fixed `引导对话` panel with a single conversation surface and quick chips.
  - Replaced the tabbed right panel with `素材选择` cards; clicking a material inserts it into the dialogue input.
  - Added a `产出看板` for generated local files.
  - Added Escape-key closing for the settings modal.
  - Adjusted backend routing so `口播内容` as positioning context no longer triggers video-script generation, while explicit `写视频脚本` / `口播脚本` / `口播稿` still do.
- Verification:
  - Served HTML contains `火花看板`, `引导对话`, `素材选择`, `产出看板`, and `openSettings`.
  - Served HTML no longer contains persistent `基础设置</h2>`, `素材与产物`, `contentType`, or `nextCard`.
  - Runtime API check: `测试灵感：...平台抖音，口播内容` -> `spark_solidify`, `spark_card`, next `审核`.
  - Runtime API check: `写视频脚本：...` -> `video_script`, next `静态页文案`.
  - Playwright desktop check confirmed gear modal, Escape close, scored spark cards, material click into dialogue input, output board, no persistent settings form, and no console errors.
  - Playwright mobile check confirmed `火花看板`, `引导对话`, `素材选择`, `产出看板`, gear entry, Escape close, and no console errors.
- Files created/modified:
  - `content-workbench/main.py`
  - `content-workbench/static/index.html`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 10 clean-entry UI is complete: settings are behind the gear, left is a scored spark board, center is a fixed dialogue, and right is material selection plus output board. |
| Where am I going? | Next product work can polish visual details or move to post-MVP hardening: deployed sync/subscription, real provider verification, installer/service packaging, and license behavior. |
| What's the goal? | Productize the content pipeline into a local-first script workflow agent with mobile inspiration sync. |
| What have I learned? | See `findings.md`. |
| What have I done? | Built and verified a local MVP, added Git rollback points, cleaned up the main UI entrances, moved settings behind a gear, added scored spark/material/output boards, and preserved/fixed routing behavior. |
